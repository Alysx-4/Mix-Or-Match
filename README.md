#Project scope and Approach

The scope of the project is to provide a platform for entertainment while learning about the historic monuments being featured.


The website will compromise of 4 components.
1.The first component consists of the title, countdown as well as the number of flips the user makes. 

2.The second component consists the background information on the game as well as the information on the Monuments featured. 

3.The third component will be the cards that are displayed which will show an animation when flipped. 


#Technology Utilized

1.HTML as the skeleton of the website.

2.CSS for the styling of the website.

3.Object oriented codes.

4.Flexbox for  features which requires a response from user.

5.Language used would be javascript for the random shuffling of cards and features. 

6.DOM.

#Difficutlties and Outcomes 

I had difficulties when it came to styling the cards as i had to make sure that there are two different pictures for each side. Also, i had a touch time trying to find an API to use which was one of the requirements to pass the project-still am not able to find one. 
Making sure that the code worked well was hard for me as i had to make sure i understood what i was doing and which feature i actually wanted to implement. 

One lesson i learned from this project would be that- i should always be sure of what i want and that planning is extremely important.
